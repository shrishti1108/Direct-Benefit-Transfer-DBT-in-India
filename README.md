# Direct-Benefit-Transfer-DBT-in-India

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

To explore and analyze DBT transfer patterns across Indian districts and states using publicly available data. The objective is to uncover regional trends, detect anomalies, and identify areas that may need administrative attention for improved DBT implementation.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Loaded dataset
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Filtered out negative/invalid values
- Outlier removal using IQR method
- Extracted `start_year` and `end_year` from `fy` (financial year)

---

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes various state-wise and district-wise visualizations:

- âœ… Bar plots of total DBT transfer and transaction volumes
- âœ… Histograms showing distribution of transactions
- âœ… Scatter plots showing correlation between volume and value
- âœ… Box plots and heatmaps for identifying outliers and correlations
- âœ… Pie charts for top contributing states/districts

Each visualization includes an interpretation to support decision-making.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- States like **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal** lead in DBT transfers.
- Some districts show disproportionately low activity, indicating gaps in implementation.
- Transaction count doesnâ€™t always align with transfer value â€” highlighting differences in per-transaction benefit.
- Year-on-year growth indicates increased adoption of digital DBT platforms.

---

## âœ… Conclusion

This analysis highlights both strengths and inefficiencies in Indiaâ€™s DBT system. The cleaned and visualized data can support equitable fund allocation, fraud detection, and digital governance planning.
